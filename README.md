# Google-Finance-Scraping
Here I've done a project from web scrping tutorial by _Andy Bek_ which gave me a good grasp of setting down a logic and developing it step-by-step. it was my first time coding **OOP** style. I should review this project over and over to implement a good knowledge of OOP programmning.
